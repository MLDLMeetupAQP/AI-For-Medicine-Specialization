    "Welcome to the second assignment of course 1. In this assignment, we will be working with the results of the X-ray classification model we developed in the previous assignment. In order to make the data processing a bit more manageable, we will be working with a subset of our training, and validation datasets. We will also use our manually labeled test dataset of 420 X-rays.  \n",

    "Of course our dataset is only a sample of the real world, and our calculated values for all above metrics is an estimate of the real world values. It would be good to quantify this uncertainty due to the sampling of our dataset. We'll do this through the use of confidence intervals. A 95\\% confidence interval for an estimate $\\hat{s}$ of a parameter $s$ is an interval $I = (a, b)$ such that 95\\% of the time when the experiment is run, the true value $s$ is contained in $I$. More concretely, if we were to run the experiment many times, then the fraction of those experiments for which $I$ contains the true parameter would tend towards 95\\%.\n",
